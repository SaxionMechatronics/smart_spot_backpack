## Suggested Changes

Below you can find a list of suggested changes:

* Remove the screw holes on the sides of the outer shell for the panels, they are not needed.
* Remove the sheet metal bends in the middle of the main mounting plate, they are not needed. Remove the corresponding screw holes on the outer shell as well.
* Make the backpack larger, the current design is very cramped when you add all the wiring.
* Decrease tolerance of nut holes of GNSS wings.
* Improve design of the GNSS wings, there are currenlty a lot of screws for such a simple part.
* Re-design the backpack to be rainproof.
