## Quality Attributes

In this section we are going to describe the key quality attributes that the system should satisfy. These are as follows:

* Modularity: It should be easy to design modular payloads for the backpack in order to facilitate the needs of different projects.
* Serviceability: The backpack should be easy to service. For instance, you should be able to service the backack while it is still mounted on SPOT.
* Usability: The backpack should not obstruct operations with SPOT in any way.
* Robust: The backpack should be robust during use.

Furthermore, it is out of scope that the backpack has to be rainproof. This decision has been motivated by the available resources (mainly time) during the development of the backpack. The backpack is meant to be a research  platform, not an actual product.

In the next section you can read about the system constraints that affected the design of the backpack.
