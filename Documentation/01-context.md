## Context

This is the open source hardware repository for the [Boston Dynamics SPOT](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) backpack from the [Smart Mechatronics And RoboTics (SMART) research group](https://www.saxion.edu/business-and-research/research/smart-industry/mechatronics) from Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

The development of this backpack was driven by a commercial model previously used within our research group, which was difficult to modify for the needs of our projects.

The backpack has been developed within the CHARISMA project and is now released as open source hardware repository to be used by researchers as a developing platform for SPOT. 
As such, the backpack the contains it's own onboard PC, power distribution system, various power and media connectors as well as an array of screw holes on the top surface for mounting additional payloads such as sensors and actuators.
