## Suggested Changes

Below you can find a list of suggested changes:

* Remove the screw holes on the sides of the outer shell for the panels, they are not needed.
* Remove the sheet metal bend in the middle of the main mounting plate, it is not needed. Remove the corresponding screw hole on the outer shell as well.
* Make the backpack larger, the current design is very cramped when you add all the wiring.
* Improve design of the GNSS wings, there are currenlty a lot of screws for such a simple part
* Re-design the backpack to be rainproof
