## Mounting Instruction

In this section we will describe how to mounted the assembled backpack onto SPOT. 


### Step 0: Preperation
Make sure SPOT is lying down on a even and stable surface. For example the ground or on top of a workbench. If you want to use the GPS antennas, they should be already mounted on the backpack.

### Step 1: Mounting rails

**Required tools:**
* Philips screw driver PH1

First, remove the middle payload cap of SPOT as indicated in Figure 1. 

> ⚠️**Note:** Make sure to save the cap of SPOT somewhere secure as the robot will [not work](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/payload/robot_electrical_interface) if either the GXP or the payload cap is not connected!

</p>

Next, place M5 sliding T-nuts into the mounting rails of spot, as depicted in Figure 2. Make sure that these are locking nuts, so they will stay in place. You can start by placing (and locking) two sliding nuts at the edge of the rail in the back. Then place the other two sliding nuts at a distance of 36 cm (hole to hole) and lock them. Verify whether the holes of the backpack line up with the holes of the sliding nuts and mark their locations (e.g. using masking tape).

### Step 2: Remove the backpack cover 

**Required tools:**
* Allen key nr 2.5 (top screws)
* Allen key nr 3 (side screws)

*Assuming that the base plate and the cover of backpack have been previsouly screwed together:*

Remove the eight screws holding the top cover of the backpack, four on the top and two on each side (indicated in the Figure 3 below). *Store them temporarily on a safe place*, we need them again to secure the top cover. Gently lift the top cover of the backpack an placing it aside.

> ⚠️**Note:** If the GSP antennas are connected to the backpack, thire USB cables may be still connected and running through the top cover. Please handle with care. You may disconnect the cables from the PC if this makes the process easier

### Step 3: Connect the GXP

**Required tools:**
* Philips screwdriver PH1

Before we actually mount the backpack to the rails, it's best to connect the GXP first to SPOT. Place the mounting plate onto SPOT and make sure the interface panel is facing to the back. Then, slighlty lift up the plate and insert the BD50 cable of the GXP to SPOT (You may need to loosen the screws of the connector first). Make sure the exiting cable is facing towards the front of SPOT as depicted in Figure 4.

Gently lower the backpack onto the mounting rails of spot. Take a Philips screwdriver PH1 and tighten (not too tight!) the GXP connector from above, see Figure 5.

</p>

 > ⚠️**Note:** Then, screw on the GXP connector, SPOT might not work otherwise!

### Step 4: Securing the mounting plate on SPOT

**Required tools:**
* Allen key nr 3

In order to secure the backpack screw-in the four M5x12 screws through the mounting holes into the sliding nuts. Figure 6 indicates the mounting holes of the backpack.

### Step 5: Connect the outershell to the mounting plate

**Required tools:**
* Allen key nr 2.5
* Allen key nr 3

Now the cover of the backpack can be placed, make sure no cables are in the way or get damaged. 

Next, place outershell on of the backpack top and screw the panels on from the top using 4x M3x10 screws (you can omit the sides of the panels). Next screw the sides of the outershell to the bends of the main plate using 4x M5x16 screws (You can ommit the holes in the middle of the shell).

This is the reverse operation of Step 2.

Voila! The result should look like the one in figure 7 (minus the payload).

### Step 6: Attach any other payload.
Attach any other additional payload to the outershell (e.g. see the Laser Hunter mount on the top). If you need to use the cable grommet, you will first need to dismount the outershell in order to connect any cables to the PC and the power distribution.

In the next section you can check what and how many scews are being used for specific parts of the backpack.
