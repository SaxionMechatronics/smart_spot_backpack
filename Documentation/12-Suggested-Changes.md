## Suggested Changes

Below you can find a list of suggested changes:

* **Make the backpack easier to mount & use**
  * Use the 2nd interface bus of SPOT (the one in the back) for the GXP instead of the one in the center. E.g., add a cutout for the interface panel such that the main wire of the GXP can hang outside of the backpack. This way we can do the following: 
    * Add screw holes on the mounting plate that extrude from the front and back panel, such that you can directly mount it on the rails from SPOT without having to remove the outer shell. 
  * Re-design the top of the outershell such that you can open it. For instance, it could be attached to the main frame as a lid and open like a "door", similar to a [control box](https://nl.rs-online.com/web/p/wall-boxes/7755798?cm_mmc=NL-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_NL_NL_Enclosures_%26_Server_Racks_Whoop-_-(NL:Whoop!)+Wall+Boxes-_-7755798&matchtype=&pla-339537441482&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwm_SzBhAsEiwAXE2Cv2Yd-r1tQG-GUobp-pl2digMqAKzzrRRr1FHzoacW6KcYeYekTzudxoCsgsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) 
* Re-design the backpack to be IP54 (same as SPOT).
* Remove the screw holes on the sides of the outer shell for the panels, they are not needed.
* Remove the sheet metal bends in the middle of the main mounting plate, they are not needed. Remove the corresponding screw holes on the outer shell as well.
* Make the backpack larger, the current design is very cramped when you add all the wiring.
* Decrease tolerance of nut holes of GNSS wings.
* Improve design of the GNSS wings, there are currenlty a lot of screws for such a simple part.
