## Principles

This section summarizes the principles that have been used to design and build the backpack. 

### Requirements

Requirements have been written based on [EARS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224079416_Easy_approach_to_requirements_syntax_EARS) and have been assigned a priority according to [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).

### Poka Yoke
[Poka Yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke) (Mistake Proofing) Designing systems or products in a way that prevents errors or mistakes by users. 
For example, M12 connectors have been chosen with specific pinouts such that users cannot accidentally insert a 24V connection into a 5V connection.

### Design for Assembly
DFA (Design for Assembly): Designing products with ease of assembly in mind to reduce assembly time, complexity, and costs. For example, 
  - Only use M3 & M5 screws with the same head in order to avoid confusion between screws and number of needed tools for assembly
  - Mount for Gas sensor is designed such that battery straps can be easily removed

### Repository maintencance 
Maintenance of the repository itself is based on [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
