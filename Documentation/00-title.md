# SMART SPOT backpack.

The documenation is inspired by Simon Brown's post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526203757/http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2016/05/31/agile_software_architecture_documentation.html):

> [...] I propose something akin to a travel guidebook. Imagine you arrive in a new city. Without any maps or a sense of direction, you'll end up just walking up and down every street trying to find something you recognise or something of interest. You can certainly have conversations with the people who you meet, but that will get tiring really quickly. If I was a new joiner on an existing software development team, what I'd personally like is something that I can sit down and read over a coffee, perhaps for an hour or so, that will give me a really good starting point to jump into and start exploring the code.

So enjoy your coffee and read the architecture of the backpack.

Note some sections of Simon Brown's guide have been removed or adjusted in order to make it fit to a hardware project:  

* Removed sections:
  * *Data*
  * *Infrastructure Architecture*
  * *Software Architecture* -> integrated in *Functional Overview* (with a system diagram of the hardware architecture)
* Renamed sections:
  * *Code* -> *Implementation*
  * *Deployment* -> *Instructions*
  * *Operations & Support* -> *Support & Contributions*
