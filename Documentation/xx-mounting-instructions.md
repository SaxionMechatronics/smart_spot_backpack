## Mounting Instruction

In this section we will describe how to mounted the assembled backpack onto SPOT. 

### Step 1: Mounting rails

First, remove the middle payload cap of SPOT. 
*Make sure to save the cap of SPOT somewhere secure as the robot will [not work](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/payload/robot_electrical_interface) if either the GXP or the payload cap is not connected!*

Next, we will place M5 sliding nuts into the mounting rails of spot. Make sure that these are locking nuts. You can start by placing (and locking) two sliding nuts at the edge of the rail in the back. Then place the other two sliding nuts at a distance of XXX cm (hole to hole) and lock them.
Verify whether the holes of the backpack line up with the holes of the sliding nuts and mark their locations (e.g. using painters tape).

### Step 2: Connect the GXP

Before we actually connect the mounting plate to the rails, it's best to connect the GXP first to SPOT. Place the mounting plate onto SPOT and make sure the interface panel is facing to the back. Then, slighlty lift up the plate and insert the BD50 cable of the GXP to SPOT (You may need to loosen the screws of the connector first). Afterwards, screw on the connector.

### Step 3: Connect the mounting plate to SPOT

Next, you can screw in the mounting plate using M5xX screws.

### Step 4: Connect the outershell to the mounting plate

Next, place outershell on of the backpack top and make sure that no cables are in the way. Then, screw the panels on from the top using M3xX screws (you can ommit the sides of the panels) and screw the sides of the outersell to the bends of the main plate using M5xX screws.

Voila!

### Step 5: Attach any other payload.
Attach any other additional payload to the outershell (e.g. see the Laser Hunter mount on the top). If you need to use the cable grommet, you will first need to dismount the outershell in order to connect any cables to the PC and the power distribution.
