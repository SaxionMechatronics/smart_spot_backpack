***

Add the part about the cap of SPOT (save it somewhhere secure.)

- Interface Panels
  - Print 2 brackets and insert heat set inserts
  - Screw the brackets to the interface panels with M3xX screws
  - For the back panel, first attach the M12 connectors, than add the Media connectors (from left to right: ethernet, USB, USB, HDMI) and finally the PWR button and the antenna cables.

***

- PWR distribution (refer to electrical diagram)
  - Print mount and insert heat set inserts
  - Cut a DIN rail (about 130mm long)
  - Mount relays and PTFIX connectors
  - Make VGA connector for GXP 
  - Relays
    - Crimp wires for the ground line of the relays and connect them together.
    - Solder a 82 ohm resistor in series for the positive LED wire of  the switch and crimp it together with the 5V lead of the GXP and connect it to NO to one of the relays. 
    - Crimp together the 2 24V leads of the GXP and the NO lead of the switch and connect it to one of  the relays. 
    - Crimp the COM lead of the switch and another “crimp chain“ for the positive line of the relays. 
    - Crimp the the 2 12V leads of the GXP together and connect to the last relay.
    - For each of the relays, crimp one end of a fuse holder and connect it to the NO port. Connect the other end of the fuse holder to the input of the PTFIX blocks. 
    - Insert the fuse blades
      - 24V → 5A
      - 12V → 10A
      - 5V → 2A
- M12 Connectors
  - Cut the wires of the M12 connectors to appropiate length
  - Solder the inline fuses to the wires ... color code ...
  - Insert fuse blades, 4A everywhere
  - Connect fuses to the PTFIX connectors ...
- PC
  - Power cables to PC. The VECOW-SPC7000 has screw terminals, you can apply some solder to the tips of the wires ...
  - Ground the PC. Show image.

- Mounting plate
  - Insert M5 rivets with a rivet tool. Be careful with the bends, its better to file a little bit of the holes away than hammering the rivet into the hole, as the bends easily bend.
  - Mount the PWR distribution board and the GXP on the “long side”, you will need to twist the connector cable of the GXP in order to connect it to SPOT 
  - Add the PC, and ground it to the mounting plate
  - The panel with all the connectors goes on the side of the Power distribution. Wire the media and the antenna cables under the power distribution board. Then, mount on the Interface panels using M3xX screws.
  - Place mounting plateon SPOT and mark the locations of the screw holes for mounting near the rails (e.g. using painters tape); insert slidy thingies into the rail
  - GXP
    - Remove cap on safe it somewhere. This short circuits connection for SPOT safety ... (refer to documentation)
    - place mounting plate on SPOT, lift it slightly up and connect the GXP wire;  screw it in place
  - Mount the mounting plate on SPOT using the slidy connectors. (the ones with screw locks). 

***

- GNNS WINGS (Optional, for CHARISMA)
  -  Add the brace by inserting the nuts into the nut holes and screw the brace to the wing.
  -  You can apply some foam to the mounting surface of the GNSS sensor
  -  Add the sensors. You can use the gaps for zipties or velcro for cable management.
  -  Make sure that you connect the right GPS sensor to the right USB port
     -  Rover → top left USB 
     -  Moving Base → bottom left USB
  
***

- Outer shell
   - Add rivet nuts with a rivet tool. You can hammer them in if needed or use a file. 
     - In general, don't apply too much force, you might rip out the threading of the rivet nuts.
     - Be careful with the side bends when using the rivet tool, you might change the shape of the bends if you excert to much force.
   - Add the cable grommet
   - Attach any additional payloads (e.g. GNSS wings or other sensor mounts. 




Put the shell on top of the mounting plate and screw it together. Use M5xX screws
